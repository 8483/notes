# STRING_AGG / mysql group_concat

```sql
select
	sku,
	STRING_AGG(category, ', ')
from categories
group by
    sku
```

# Only numbers

```sql
select barcode
from barcodes
where barcode not like '%[^0-9]%'
```

# Remove trailing zeros

```sql
select cast(barcode as int)
```

# Order a sub-query

Using `top 99.9999 percent` is a hack to achieve the ordering.

Note that `top 100 percent` won't work.

```sql
select
    sku,
    STRING_AGG(attribute, ', ') attributes
from (
    select top 99.9999999999999 percent
        sku,
        attribute
    from attributes
    order by
        sku asc,
        attribute asc
) t1
group by sku
```

# Declare Variables

```sql

DECLARE @date DATETIME = '07.01.2019'

-- from select
DECLARE @count INT;
SET @count = (SELECT COUNT(sku) FROM product)
SELECT @count;
```

# UPDATE from SELECT / TABLE

SQL server

```sql

UPDATE product
SET product.price = t2.newPrice
FROM (
    SELECT sku, newPrice
    FROM pricelist
) t2
WHERE product.sku = t2.sku

-- table
UPDATE product
SET product.price = t2.newPrice
FROM t2
WHERE product.sku = t2.sku
```

MySQL

```sql

```

# INSERT from SELECT

```

# DELETE from LEFT JOIN

```sql

    SUM(profit) OVER(ORDER BY profit desc ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS profitRunning, -- cummulative sum of profit
    SUM(profit) OVER () AS profitTotal, -- sum of profit column
    SUM(profit) OVER(ORDER BY profit desc ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) / SUM(profit) OVER () profitShare
FROM sales
```

# Partition By

We use this to make a "sub-query" i.e. select n-th item from a table for further use.

### Data

```sql
SELECT
    clientID,
    invoiceDate,
    revenue
FROM sales
```

| clientID | invoiceDate | revenue  |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1017     | 2019-01-31  | 6574.65  |
| 116      | 2018-02-05  | 5593.22  |
| 1211     | 2018-01-15  | 3637.80  |
| 116      | 2018-02-16  | 1848.00  |
| 1211     | 2018-01-09  | 15615.65 |
| 1017     | 2019-02-14  | 1386.00  |
| 1211     | 2018-02-09  | 16145.72 |
| 116      | 2018-02-13  | 2784.51  |
| 1211     | 2018-03-28  | 8844.64  |

### Data with PARTITION BY

In this case, we want to have the latest sale for each client. We can achieve this by partitioning the data i.e. ordering the sales for each client in descending order based on the date. We can then select only the desired row with `rowNumber`.

```sql
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY clientID ORDER BY invoiceDate DESC) rowNumber,
    clientID,
    invoiceDate,
    revenue
FROM sales
```

| rowNumber | clientID | invoiceDate | revenue  |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1         | 1017     | 2019-02-14  | 1386.00  |
| 2         | 1017     | 2019-01-31  | 6574.65  |
| 1         | 116      | 2018-02-16  | 1848.00  |
| 2         | 116      | 2018-02-13  | 2784.51  |
| 3         | 116      | 2018-02-05  | 5593.22  |
| 1         | 1211     | 2018-03-28  | 8844.64  |
| 2         | 1211     | 2018-02-09  | 16145.72 |
| 3         | 1211     | 2018-01-15  | 3637.80  |
| 4         | 1211     | 2018-01-09  | 15615.65 |

### Result

```sql
SELECT
    lastSale.clientID,
    lastSale.invoiceDate,
    lastSale.revenue
FROM (
    SELECT
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY clientID ORDER BY invoiceDate DESC) rowNumber,
        clientID,
        invoiceDate,
        revenue
    FROM sales
) lastSale
WHERE lastSale.rowNumber = 1
```

We only get the first row for each client i.e. the last sale (sorted by descending invoice date).

| acReceiver | adDate     | sales   |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1017       | 2019-02-14 | 1386.00 |
| 116        | 2018-02-16 | 1848.00 |
| 1211       | 2018-03-28 | 8844.64 |

### Duplicates

```sql
SELECT
    sku
FROM (
    SELECT
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY sku ORDER BY sku asc) rowNumber,
        sku
    FROM product
) duplicates
WHERE rowNumber > 1
```

# MAX, AVERAGE, SUM... Across columns

```sql
select
    *,
    (
        select max(v)
        from (
            values
                (sales2017),
                (sales2018),
                (sales2019)
        ) as value(v)
    ) as maxSales
from sales
```

# CTE - Common Table Expression

It defines a temporary result set which can be used in a SELECT statement.

```sql
WITH
    salesrep AS (
        SELECT
            employeeNumber,
            CONCAT(firstName, ' ', lastName) AS salesrepName
        FROM
            employees
        WHERE
            jobTitle = 'Sales Rep'
    ),
    customer_salesrep AS (
        SELECT
            customerName, salesrepName
        FROM
            customers
                INNER JOIN
            salesrep ON employeeNumber = salesrepEmployeeNumber
    )
SELECT
    *
FROM
    customer_salesrep
ORDER BY customerName;
```

# Rollup (Total Row)

`ROLLUP` is a subclause of the `GROUP BY` clause which provides a shorthand for defining multiple grouping sets. Unlike the `CUBE` subclause, `ROLLUP` does not create all possible grouping sets based on the dimension columns; the `CUBE` makes a subset of those.

When generating the grouping sets, `ROLLUP` assumes a hierarchy among the dimension columns and only generates grouping sets based on this hierarchy.

The `ROLLUP` is often used to generate subtotals and totals for reporting purposes.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    category,
    SUM(sales) sales
FROM
    sales.sales_summary
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP(brand, category)
```

This will result in

| brand | category | sales |             |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Honda | cars     | 100   |
| Honda | bikes    | 200   |
| Honda | NULL     | 300   | Subtotal    |
| BMW   | cars     | 400   |
| BMW   | bikes    | 500   |
| BMW   | NULL     | 900   | Subtotal    |
| NULL  | NULL     | 1200  | Grand Total |

# Pivot

In order for the pivoting to work, we must **only use the columns needed**, instead of all of them. This results in repeating rows.

### **Data**

Here is some example data, obtained by the given query.

| product | yearSold | revenue       |
| ------- | -------- | ------------- |
| shoes   | 2018     | 33924978.2497 |
| shirts  | 2018     | 34362105.196  |
| hats    | 2018     | 25119529.9395 |
| shoes   | 2019     | 6947797.012   |
| shirts  | 2019     | 8070039.2266  |
| hats    | 2019     | 5780623.5762  |

```sql
SELECT
    product,
    yearSold,
    revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY
    yearSold,
    product
```

### **Result**

![TEA](../pics/sql/pivot_unpivot.png)

| product | 2019 | 2018 |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| shoes   | 694  | 3392 |
| shirts  | 807  | 3436 |
| hats    | 578  | 2511 |

### **Approach 1 - FROM**

```sql
SELECT
    product,  -- grouping column
    [2019],   -- spreading value 1
    [2018]    -- spreading value 2
FROM (
    SELECT
        product,      -- grouping column
        yearSold,     -- spreading column
        revenue       -- aggregation column
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY
        yearSold,
        product
) PivotData
    PIVOT (
        SUM(revenue)   -- aggregation function (aggregation column)
        FOR yearSold   -- spreading column
        IN (
            [2019],    -- spreading value 1
            [2018])    -- spreading value 2
        ) piv
```

### **Approach 2 - WITH (CTE)**

```sql
WITH PivotData AS (
    SELECT
        product,
        yearSold,
        revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY
        yearSold,
        product
)

SELECT
    product,
    [2019],
    [2018]
FROM PivotData
    PIVOT (
        SUM(revenue)
        FOR [year]
        IN (
            [2019],
            [2018])
        ) piv
```

# Dynamic Pivot

The SQL Server `COALESCE` function handles `NULL` values.

The expression accepts a number of arguments, evaluates them in sequence, and returns the first non-null argument.

```sql
SELECT COALESCE (NULL,'A','B')                     -- A
SELECT COALESCE (NULL,100,20,30,40)                -- 100
SELECT COALESCE (NULL,NULL,20,NULL,NULL)           -- 20
SELECT COALESCE (NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'foo')   -- foo
SELECT COALESCE (NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'foo')      -- 1
SELECT COALESCE (NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'foo',1) -- coversion failed when converting the varchar value 'foo' to data type int
```

-   Define variables
-   Define columns (**must be strings**)
-   Define SQL query
-   Execute the query

The column definition can also be done with this:

```sql
SELECT STRING_AGG(PIVOT_COLUMN, ',')
```
