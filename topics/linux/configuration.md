# Configuration

**Make a BACKUP before any edits** with `cp file file.ORIGINAL`

All config files are located in `/etc/`. They are plain text files.  

Use the `less` program to view configuration files, instead of an editor. Ex. `less /etc/ssh/sshd_config`.  

`/`+`string` - Search inside **less** (case sensitive).  
`q` - Exit.
