BERT vs GPT?

# LLM

LLMs (Large language models) are text completion engines

Examples: gpt-3.5, gpt-4, hugginface, llama

# autoGPT

It’s a thinking AI basically, Chat GPT is just LLM. A LLM is like a baby without understanding, but using tools like Langchain and Pinecone you can teach the AI task. Auto GPT on has a few task, it’s really like a template to build your own thinking AI.

Research Langchain and Pinecone to get a better understanding of the potential.

# Custom AI

2 ways to do this:

1. Finetune LLM (Behave a certain way ex. talk like Trump) - Re-train the model. More complex, saves cost.
2. Knowledge base. (Gain domain knowledge) - Create embeddings and store them in a vector database, which is the searched for and fed into an LLM prompt.
