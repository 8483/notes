2 schools of advertising:

-   Brand awareness (most people think this is marketing) - Billboards, 30 second TV commercials, print ads, witty jingles, cute slogans

-   Direct response - Like "infomercials", you must respond directly to the ad to take advantage of what is offered. You call a specific number set up for tracking.

With direct response, you **know** how much the ads are making i.e. which sales tactics work.

# Direct response

Wrtiting a sales pitch that prompts action now, not later. A direct response copywriter is a salesperson in print that gets 3%-7% commission on top of the $5,000 base pay to write the copy.

It started a long time ago with "mail order catalogues". Businesses place ads inside them, which are then mailed to 100,000 people, who send their orders via mail.

2% conversion rate is enough for a campaign to be successful.

# Split test

"Beat the control"

Control is the best performing ad, and the goal is to alter the copy until the new ad becomes the control.

# Formula

Emotionally compelling primary promise + delivery mechanism = Intellectually interesting appeal (big idea)

Intellectually interesting appeal (big idea) = How doest the primary promise work with the delivery mechanism

Delivery mechanism = gimmick, hook
Makes the common seem novel
