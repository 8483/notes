# Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**A CSRF vulnerability enables an attacker to perform actions on a website via an authenticated user.**

In a CSRF attack, the attacker makes a request to a third party page in the background, for instance by sending a POST request to your bank website. If you have a valid session with your bank, any website can make a request in the background that will be carried out unless your bank uses counter measures against CSRF.
