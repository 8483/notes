# Summary

-   Creative work must to be done in 8-hour uninteruppted blocks.
-   TODO list first. Meetings, emails and slack second.
-   WRITE SHIT DOWN in meetings! Otherwise, it never happened.
-   Have visible KPIs, on a screen 24/7.
-   Willpower isn't enough. You need tools as well.
-   The two things that ridiculously de-risk your startup are:

    1. Talk to you customers.
    2. Build and launch products.

-   Pick one avenue and stick to it. An equally competent team that is all-in will always beat you.

# Maker vs Manager schedule

[Paul Graham's article](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

## Maker schedule

```
Creative work must to be done in 8-hour uninteruppted blocks.
```

By creative we mean programmers, musicians, actors...

Eliminate meetings. Define a goal, and follow up each week on it instead.

The makes schedule works for managers as well.

## Manager schedule

```
TODO list first. Meetings, emails and slack second.
```

Do everything in the TODO list before moving on to other things.

# Meetings

All advice for effective meetings can be summed up in one sentence...

```
WRITE SHIT DOWN! Otherwise, it never happened.
```

The worst thing is having meetings because nothing was written down from the last one.

Notebooks are good for ideas. Todo apps are a must.

Writing things in a notebooks = gone forever.

# Visible KPIs

```
Have  visible KPIs, on a screen 24/7.
```

Become obsessed with the numbers, so you know them by heart.

You should know instantly if you are having an up or down week.

# Distractions

```
Willpower isn't enough. You need tools as well.
```

Super productive people are agressively abnormal with protecting their time.

There are two sets of tools:

-   Organize your time better.
-   Protect your time.

# De-risking

The collection of mentors, startup events, tutorials... It makes it look like your are doing work.

```
The two things that ridiculously de-risk your startup are:

1. Talk to you customers.
2. Build and launch products.
```

# Hedging bets

Juggling multiple things at once like thinking about grad school, looking for job offers, investing in crypto, joining accelerators and talking about doing a startup...

```
Pick one avenue and stick to it. An equally competent team that is all-in will always beat you.
```
