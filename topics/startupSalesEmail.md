# Structure

-   Greeting and softener.
-   Outline logic for the targeted personal email.
-   Introduce yourself, your role at your company, and outline your company’s product/service in a way that clearly and directly solves a top 3 challenge for the prospect in their role at target company.
-   Suggest a meet/call to outline the aspects of notable relevance.
-   Close with an assumptive feeler about the best time/date to speak.

# Subject Line

Referencing the product or service in your subject line will reduce open rates, so don’t do it. Something more ambiguous works better in 90% of cases. I.e. “2017 plans” or “London next week” etc.

Here’s how you need to craft a short mail that engages prospects.

# Content

**Write the content as if every word costs \$1,000.**

-   Forget feature and benefit lists. Instead just outline the end result without worrying too much about the mechanics and steps involved.
-   Forget everything you have read about social proof. Delete those three big-named clients: instead tell your prospect you know exactly how your service/product will make a big difference at their company.
-   Drop the marketing language and jargon. Tell it in plain English using simple, uncomplicated sentences.
-   Avoid obvious data insertions. Data insertions are a fantastic way to target mails – but they’re a real turn-off if they’re noticeable. Always reality check samples of your mails before hitting send.
-   Save the discounts and special offers. For an engagement mail there’s no need to start desperately discounting. You need to sell your proposition not start skimming off its price.
-   PDF attachments and web links are a no-no. Your marketing department is going to love you. Not only have you discarded all their carefully crafted sales copy in favour of a conversational tone but you are also going to need to refuse to attach their latest promo piece or insert a link to their latest video or landing page. The fact is, when you look at the stats attachments and web links just distract your prospects from your main aim: to get in contact to find out more.

Hi Dave,

I read your post on cloud migration last week – really got me thinking about your approach.

Mind if I drop you a call… I have a couple of thoughts I wanted to run past you?

Do you have a few minutes on Thurs?

Cheers
