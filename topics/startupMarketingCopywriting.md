# Pitch

> Lead with what, not why.

|          |                                                                                                                                  |

| **Bad**  | Many of my friends are super confused about their stock options, and it pisses me off how stressed they get thinking about them. |
| **Good** | [PRODUCT NAME] lets companies plan, communicate and benchmark your compensation in real-time (without spreadsheets)              |

Good examples:

-   Airbnb: We built the first marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals, instead of hotels
-   OpenQ: Find ant talk to yourB2B users fast.
-   Yung: Adaptive, ML-driven mental health for your team. Better: Personalized, digital therapy programs for your team.

TIPS:

-   Avoid meaningless marketing speak and jargon. Be conversational.
-   Don' ramble.
-   Avoid X for Y descriptions. Can be used only:
    -   X should be a household name.
    -   Does Y want X?
    -   Y should be a huge market.

# Landing page

Focus on communicating these:

-   What is it?
-   How it works?
-   Is it for me? (explain the value, not the benefits ex. increase sales vs have precise reports)

Try to show use cases based on user personas. ex. managers, sales, marketing, accounting...

# 2 schools of advertising

**Brand awareness**

Мmost people think this is marketing... ex. Billboards, 30 second TV commercials, print ads, witty jingles, cute slogans...

**Direct response**

Like "infomercials", you must respond directly to the ad to take advantage of what is offered. You call a specific number set up for tracking.

With direct response, you **know** how much the ads are making i.e. which sales tactics work.

# Direct response

Wrtiting a sales pitch that prompts action now, not later. A direct response copywriter is a salesperson in print that gets 3%-7% commission on top of the $5,000 base pay to write the copy.

It started a long time ago with "mail order catalogues". Businesses place ads inside them, which are then mailed to 100,000 people, who send their orders via mail.

2% conversion rate is enough for a campaign to be successful.

# Split test

**Beat the control!**

Control is the best performing ad, and the goal is to alter the copy until the new ad becomes the control.

# Formula

```
Emotionally compelling primary promise + delivery mechanism = Intellectually interesting appeal (big idea)

Intellectually interesting appeal (big idea) = How does the primary promise work with the delivery mechanism

Delivery mechanism = gimmick, a hook which makes the common seem novel
```
