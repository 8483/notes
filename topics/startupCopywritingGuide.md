Copywriting is a core business skill.

No matter what marketing channel you use, the foundation for any content IS COPYWRITING.

-   An affiliate blog post? COPYWRITING.
-   A YouTube video? A good script is written with COPYWRITING.
-   A social media caption? COPYWRITING again.
-   A landing page? 100% COPYWRITING.

The job of a marketing copywriter is to turn a need into a want.

# Classification

There are three ways to classify copy and anything you write will typically fit somewhere in them:

-   **Collateral** – Letter, brochure, web page
-   **Medium** – Videо, print, online
-   **Style** – Hard sell, scare, straight shot

# Medium

Online, print, radio, in person. Mobile, social media, website are not. These are channels.
A medium is a pipe over which the message passes, not the environment in which the audience receives it.
The medium may or may not impact the collateral on style. It usually doesn’t.

# Style

-   **Teaching** – Learn first, CTA later. CTA is "Please understand why you need this."
-   **The Straight Shot** – You describe what you have, why it’s the best and then deliver the CTA. The most common style. Use it when the customer is ready to buy and understands why he needs the product. It is often low key, as it points features and leaves the audience to take action.
-   **Laughter** – Use self-deprecating humor, ridicule the customers that don’t buy, a funny version of the scare tactic. Use it when you know the audience, because it can backfire spectacularly.
-   **Scare Tactic** – "Do this or bad stuff will happen". Use it when there’s more at stake than a sale. "Fasten your seat-belt", "Don’t drink and drive"…
-   **Hard Sell** – "BUY NOW! LIMITED OFFER" The CTA is usually repeated between the reasons why to buy.

# Evoke emotions

Purchases are made because customers FEEL like the product or service helps them reduce pain or increase pleasure... or both!

ALWAYS make them FEEL like you are the best option.

# Focus on pain

Avoiding pain is a way stronger motivation to take action than seeking pleasure.

"Make $10,000 a month with product" vs "Stop losing $10,000 a month with product". Which one is more compelling?

# Talk like it's the first time

Write like you're explaining for the first time. Assume they are children, and you only have ONE chance to make an impression.

All great copy entertains, educates, convinces and feels personal.

Steps:

-   Invoke interest
-   Elaborate on it
-   Present a solution
-   Support with evidence
-   Address possible objections
-   Close off with a clear CTA

# Share their struggle

Read their mind. Quote the target audience's exact words and frustrations back at them.

Share their struggle. Make it seem like both of you are going through the same thing. Emphasize how you experienced the same problem and how you solved it.

# Emotional words

Use textured adjectives and verbs to let the audience "feel" behind a screen.

-   Check out this ~~luxurious~~ **velvety** scarf.
-   A simple ~~interior~~ **rustic** interior.
-   This ~~fun~~ **sizzling** party.
-   ~~Including~~ **Peppering** keywords everywhere.

# Personalize CTAs

Use the Endownment effect. Make them feel they're claiming what they already own. Make them buy before they buy.

# Active voice

-   Active = "The cat chased the mouse." - The subject performs the action.
-   Passive = "The mouse was chased by the cat." - The subject receives the action.

# Write like you talk

Read out loud. If it sounds cringe or weird…

Start over. Because that’s not how you talk.

(Notice how I've been speaking in the first-person and speaking directly to you this whole time?)

I'm treating you like a close friend and teaching you from my own experience. It should feel like both of us are sitting at the bar and having this conversation.

# Remove commas:

-   Improve readability. Prevents choppiness and makes sentences read more smoothly.
-   Increase pacing. Commas naturally forces readers to pause which reduces - retention.
-   Reduces complexity. Introducing multiple clauses with commas will make sentences complex and confusing.
-   Eliminate fluff. Forced to remove filler and fluff words.

# Use humor

Use funny analogies. Think of Mark Manson's writing style.

# Avoid jargon.

A 5 year old would not know them.

# Use short sentences

But why?

Because people skim.

They don’t read everything.

And don't lie…

Neither did you.

Huge walls of text are unappealing and suffocating to read.

The important points get drowned out, and your readers may completely miss them.

Keep your sentences light and short to accommodate skimming.

And suck them into focal points using other text formatting options like:

-   **Bolding**
-   Bulleted lists
-   _Italics_

# Formatting

-   No more than 15 words per line.
-   No more than 5-6 lines per paragraph.
-   No more than 3-4 paragraphs without a subhead.
-   Line height should equal 1.6x font size.
-   Line width should allow 15-20 words.
-   Use at least 1.6x as much space between paragraphs as between lines.

# Mistakes

-   Lacking Clarity
-   Neglecting the Product’s Unique Selling Point
-   Overemphasizing Brand Identity
-   Disregarding Customer Awareness Levels
-   Providing Insufficient Information
-   Showing No Proof of Claims
-   Using Clichés or Overused Phrases
-   Snooze-Worthy Headlines
-   Weak Call-to-Action
-   No Call-to-Action
-   Faking Urgency

# Example - Harrison Helmets

Features:

-   Lightest on the market
-   Highest safety ratings
-   Heating/cooling pads
-   Best graphic choices
-   Simple atttachment system

Audience:

-   Consumers

    -   Cyclists looking for protection
    -   Believe current helmets are less than ideal
    -   Who will buy online or from retailers
    -   Who already own helmets, but share with friends

-   Retailers

### Free writing

Start a timer and write for 5-10 minutes... DO NOT worry about grammar!

```
What am i going to write? I've hit my head cycling enough times. I've been wearing a helmet every time. It saved my life at least three times that I know of. But they;re awfully uncomfortable, even now. Plus, they make me look like an over inflated mushroom. And they make sweat drip directly into my eyes, which may ironically cause more accidents. Harrison's helmets really help because they're so light, about half the weight of my current helmet. And it seems to have better safety ratings than it. Why? I have to tell the audience why, how HArrison managed this, or they won't believe me. Hmmm, can't think of an idea...

Oh wait, we can do a cross-section fo the helmet, and talk about the Unobtainium shell. That's a whole new material, right? Folks have never seen it before. Doesn't a pro racer already use his helmet? We should get a quote from him too. And play up how cool it looks. This helmet looks more like a TRON helmet than a bicycle helmet. And I can get glow-in-the-dark flames. Well, I woudln't want those, but it certainly demonstrates the range of color schemes you can get.

Ok, so I need to emphasize:
    - The light weight
    - The strength
    - The colorful awesomeness
    - Testimonials

Oooh! And maybe do something like drive a car over it, and then over a competing helmet.
```

-   Don't write the introduction first. Write from the inside out.
-   Don't sweat grammar, spelling and word choice.
-   Write one "chink" per sprint.

### Headline

Avoid mysterious headlines. Ex. "The banging of the head", "Brain matter, protected", "Brain-injury risks"...

**The "blank sheet of paper" test**

> If you write the headline on a blank sheet of paper, and show it to strangers, they should understand it, or at least the basic concept behind it.

Good headlines:

```

Strong, Light, Protective: The HH1 Cycling Helmet
How the HH1 Helmet Might Save Your Life
All This and Brains Too: The HH1 Cycling Helmet
