# Campaign Structure

```
- 1 CAMPAIGN PER PRODUCT/OFFER
- 3-5 AD SETS PER CAMPAIGN
- 1-2 INTEREST PER AD SET
- 3-4 ADS PER AD SET, DUPLICATE ACROSS AD SETS
- REMARKETING INSIDE AD SET, NOT SEPARATE CAMPAIGN

**Test the ads and pick the best performer. Add new ads to test against the best performer. Repeat while iterating over different creatives, headlines and copy until you find the perfect ad.**

# Facebook Ads - B2B & owners targeting

The targeting works as `OR` meaning it includes everyone that matches some of the criteria, **NOT** all of the criteria i.e. `AND`.

Notes:

-   **Always click on suggestions when filtering**
-   Exclude pixel audiences so that you ensure you are targeting new people
-   Try to move away from interest based targeting towards lookalike audiences

## Targeting

Best:

-   **Lookalike Audience** from existing customers (emails)

Decent:

-   Facebook page/business admins (digital activities)
-   People who follow business content i.e. Forbes magazine
-   People who follow competitors

Unreliable:

-   Small business owners (digital activities)
-   Job titles ex. CEO, owner, founder...
