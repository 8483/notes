# Overview

Hubs and switches create networks.  
Routers connect networks.

# Connect Networks

## **Modem**

Converts the internet's analog signals to digital ones for your computer, and vice-versa.

Establishes a connection to your ISP, and bings the internet into your home or business.

Comes before the router, usually bundled together.

You can connect directly to the modem, but a router is needed for multiple devices.

Short for modulator/demodulator.

## **Router**

The **gateway** of a network.

Routes data from one network to another based on their IP address.

It determines if the data is for its own network and receives it, or forwards it to another one if it's not.

Comes after the modem, usually bundled together.

Passes your internet connection to all your devices via its built in switch for wired connections or access point for wireless ones.

# Create and expand networks

These devices do not read IP addresses, only MAC.

## **Switch**

Detects and identifies **specific** devices connected to it.

Routes a signal to a specific device connected via ethernet, by storing its MAC address.

Routers have one built in.

It's a smart hub.

## **Hub**

Only detects devices connected to it.

Routes a signal to **all** connected devices via ethernet.
