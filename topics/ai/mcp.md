# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> MCP makes it easier to expose new tools to LLMs.

An open-source standard for building APIs in a way that makes it easier for LLMs to connect to them.

Other standards include REST, RPC, SOAP and GraphQL.

MCP is an API that calls other APIs.

The clients sends a prompt, and MPC figures out which API to call next.

To actually use MCP, you need a client that supports the MCP protocol, like Claude Desktop.
