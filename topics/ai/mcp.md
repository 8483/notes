# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

A new standard for building APIs.

Other standards include REST, RPC, SOAP and GraphQL.

MCP is an API that calls other APIs.

The clients sends a prompt, and MPC figures out which API to call next.

To actually use MCP, you need a client that supports the MCP protocol, like Claude Desktop.
