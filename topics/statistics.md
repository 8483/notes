# Probability

Probability of happening
```
1 / possible outcomes
1 / 4 = 25%
```

Happening in a row (3 times)
```
Probability ^ instances
0.25 ^ 3 = 0.0156 ~ 1.5%
```

**NOT** happening
```
1 - probability
1 - 0.25 = 0.75
```

**NOT** happening in a row (15 times)
```
Probability NOT ^ instances
(1 - 0.25) ^ 15
0.75 ^ 15 = 0.133 ~ 13%
```

Happening after **NOT** happening (15 times)
```
1 - (1 - 0.25) ^ 15
1 - 0.75 ^ 15
1 - 0.133 = 0.867 ~ 87%
```
