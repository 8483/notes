# vimrc - Customization

The global `.vimrc` file is located in `/etc/vim/vimrc` or `etc/vimrc`.

Create a `.vimrc` file in the `home` directory for customizations.

When vim is opened, it will automatically check the current userâ€™s home directory for a .vimrc file. All settings specified in this file will override the global settings.

Configurations can be made inside `vim` by using `:set number`.

```bash
set nocompatible    # Set compatibility to Vim only.
set number          # Show line numbers.
set visualbell	    # Use visual bell (no beeping)
set wrap            # Word wrap.

set autoindent	    # Auto-indent new lines
set shiftwidth=4    # Number of auto-indent spaces
set smartindent	    # Enable smart-indent
set smarttab	    # Enable smart-tabs
set softtabstop=4   # TAB is 4 spaces.
```
