It's a query language for APIs.

GraphQL solves a people problem, not a technical one. If you don't have the problem of too many people working with the same data model, you don't need GraphQL

GraphQL sounds like the ORM of HTTP APIs.

GraphQL is an alternative to REST API. It's a typed query language.

It allows flexible querying from the front-end i.e. client.

It solves the problem of needing **just** a piece of data, without getting all the data from an end-point.

REST API would handle this for a `GET /user` request with:

-   `GET /user-slim` - Lots of routes and updating.
-   `GET /user?data=slim` - The API becomes complex

GraphQL would handle this with `POST /user` by sending this query expression in the body.

```js
{
    query {           // operation type
        user {        // operation end-point
            name      // requested field
            age
        }
    }
}
```

GraphQL **always** uses `POST` because it sends the query expression.

| REST API                 | GraphQL                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| GET                      | `query` operation type    |
| POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE | `mutation` operation type |
| Routes                   | Query definitions         |
| Controllers              | Resolvers                 |
