ps -ef | grep <criteria>   # Find a specific process.
kill -9 <pid>              # Kill a process by id.
```

# Environment Variables

PATH is an enviroment variable. It tells your machine where to search for program executables, so when you run your **picc** program you can just do `picc` instead of `/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin/picc`.

```bash
env            # List all variables.
echo "$HOME"   # Specific variable, in this case **$PATH**.
```

Add paths to `~/.profile` to make them permanent. Paths require the `bin`, while variables don't.

**The variable is not in the environment until you export it. Otherwise it's just a shell variable.**

Paths are delimited with a colon `:`

```bash
# Method 1
vim ~/.profile # Edit this file.
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" # Find this line.
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH:/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin" # Change it into this.
# It appends the new path to the existing system ones, just for this user.

# Method 2 - Shorthand to avoid editing manually.
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin" # export <VARIABLE>="<VALUE>"
```

# Password Generator

Generate a random 14 character password by using the linux `/dev/urandom` file, a stream of mashed system data.

`cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc a-zA-Z0-9 | head -c 14`

# Ubuntu on Windows

`C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\lxss\home\user` - Filesystem location.

`cd /mnt/` - Navigate to My Computer (C:, D:).

# How to Compile and Run a C Program

```bash
# Create file
touch hello.c

# Edit file
vim hello.c
```

Paste this C code in the file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
    printf("Hello World\n");
}
```

```bash
# Compile the code into hello program
gcc -o hello hello.c

# Run the program
./hello
```
