# Terminal vs shell

A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. Most often the user interacts with the shell using a command-line interface (CLI). The terminal is a program that opens a graphical window and lets you interact with the shell.

```
Terminal --> shell --> kernel --> hardware
```

Terminal - It is not a shell, but rather a window serving a shell (xterm, konsole).  
Shell - The actual CLI that executes commands (bash, zsh)
